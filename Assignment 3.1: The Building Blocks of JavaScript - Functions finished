<!-- This will be an underwater base management game -->
<!-- submitting two different versions of this assignment. one will be my faulty one with all the notes and lines of code and one will be the fixed one
 This one will highlight what i did wrong to show i learned and understood where i went wrong
 A LOT of this i just learned by myself doing research and i do not fully understand certain aspects of it cause i am just begginning to learn how to do this. if you want to add
 any useful tips or explanations i would greatly appreciate it. -->
